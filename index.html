            <h2>About Community Schools in NYC</h2>
            <p>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has pledged to "create a unified effort to develop a minimum of <a href="http://www.billdeblasio.com/issues/education" target="_blank">100 new community schools</a> in the city by the end of his first term." <a href="http://www.childrensaidsociety.org/community-schools" target="_blank">The Children's Aid Society</a> has pioneered the community schools movement since 1992, individually running 16 full-service community schools. Community schools create partnerships between a school and the resources in its surrounding community to provide wrap-around services that are shown to improve student success.</p>
            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            <p>One of the key next steps in putting Mayor de Blasio's plan into action is determining where and how to ramp up his community schools initiative.</p>
            <p>NYC is best served by leveraging current existing school-community partnerships across the city which have the experience and capacity to support the goals of the community schools initiative. This project seeks to visualize the density of quality partnerships throughout the city.</p>
            <p>Partnerships displayed on this map were selected based on the extent they engage community partners that would be integrated into schools and have a holistic vision of addressing student performance that includes a family and/or broader community focus. The partnerships selected are meant to reflect high profile partnerships that resemble “community school partnerships." Therefore, additional quality partnerships may exist between independent schools and local community based organizations that are not reflected on this map.</p>
            <p>This project is a collaboration between Urban Policy and Management Graduate Students at the <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/public-engagement/milano-school/" target="_blank">Milano School for International Affiars, Management and Urban Policy at The New School.</a></p>
