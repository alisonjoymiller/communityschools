                <h2>About Community Schools in NYC</h2>
                <p>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has pledged to "create a unified effort to develop a minimum of <a href="http://www.billdeblasio.com/issues/education" target="_blank">100 new community schools</a> in the city by the end of his first term." <a href="http://www.childrensaidsociety.org/community-schools" target="_blank">The Children's Aid Society</a> has pioneered the community schools movement since 1992, individually running 16 full-service community schools. Community schools create partnerships between a school and the resources in its surrounding community to provide wrap-around services that are shown to improve student success.</p>

                <h2>About This Project</h2>
                <p>One of the key next steps in putting Mayor de Blasio's plan into action is determining where and how to ramp up his community schools initiative.</p>
                <p>NYC is best served by leveraging current existing school-community partnerships across the city which have the experience and capacity to support the goals of the community schools initiative.</p>
                <p>This project seeks to visualize the density of these partnerships throughout the city.</p>
                <p>This project is a collaboration between Urban Policy and Management Graduate Students at the <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/public-engagement/milano-school/" target="_blank">Milano School for International Affiars, Management and Urban Policy at The New School.</a></p>
